Over the past month I have been participating in Google Code-in (#gci2016) and it has been a great journey for me! It is all about [FOSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_and_open-source_software) development, and all of the challenges and skills involved. I discovered it through a recommended [blog post](http://m4tx.pl/en/2014/05/google-code-in-2013-grand-prize-trip/) written by m4tx, a graduated student from my school who participated in 2013. After reading his blog post, I got motivated to follow his workflow and chose to do tasks for Wikimedia. So after studying the contest rules, I signed up for the contest and got my first task started.

I already had [some experiences](https://github.com/codebucketdev?tab=overview&from=2016-12-01&to=2016-12-31) in contributing to free open-source software development, so tools like Git or Gerrit weren't anything new for me. Also I had got a look 2 years ago as a intern in closed-source software development, where version control using Git was heavily used to work together in team. But I never was able to collaborate with others on a project of a such scale like Wikimedia was.

### Wait, do you mean Wikipedia or isn't this a typo? :confused:
No. The Wikimedia Foundation is the non-profit organization behind Wikipedia, Wiktionary, Wikiquote and other wiki projects, while MediaWiki is the software that powers all of these sites. [Click here](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Differences_between_Wikipedia,_Wikimedia,_MediaWiki,_and_wiki) to read more about the differences between Wikipedia, Wikimedia, MediaWiki, and wiki.

## How was my experience with Wikimedia?

At the beginning I was a little bit confused of the fact that they host the code on [Gerrit](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/) and fill bug reports on [Phabricator](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/), instead of doing that on GitHub. So the first thing that I did, is adding a [small note](https://www.mediawiki.org/w/index.php?title=Gerrit/Tutorial&diff=2299207&oldid=2275142) to the Gerrit/Tutorial page on MediaWiki for future contributors like me. :smile:

Setting up the development environment using [MediaWiki-Vagrant](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki-Vagrant) was an easy task and done within 2 hours on my old laptop, on which I installed Ubuntu 16.10 beforehand. Also, I decided to setup an IRC bouncer to be always up-to-date with conversations in the IRC channels while I'm away. For that purpose I simply installed [ZNC](http://wiki.znc.in/ZNC) on my VPS, setup the IRC network and joined some channels. Now I can connect my IRC client to my VPS, instead to Freenode and close it without missing any interesting conversations or messages, nice!

After that, I began my work by selecting my first task. I decided to skip maybe the beginner tasks, as they weren't challenging enough for me. :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye: So I ended up with picking up a small task, to warmup, which said ["WikidataPageBanner when using page images generated API renders badly cropped images"](https://phabricator.wikimedia.org/T131424). It was a nice feel to submit [my first patch](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/#/c/324775/) to Gerrit for review, as I didn't know what feedback to expect from your mentors. After my change got merged and the task on GCI was approved, I claimed more and more tasks, as my goal was to finish one task every 2 days. I wrote code in PHP and JavaScript, with each change improving (or sometimes destroying) some parts of the MediaWiki related projects like [extensions](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Category:Extensions) or the core itself. And with time to time I learned to get more familiar with the [APIs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface), I began to understand where to look and how to search for the things I needed. With that knowledge I was able to complete my tasks faster and better.

Yes, you could say that I motivated myself to keep going, but it was definitely worth doing that. :muscle:  
Here is a sample of the tasks I did:

 - [Replaced wrong message-key used in NewsletterDiffEngine.php](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/328563)
 - [Removed deprecated class ImageGallery](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/329773)
 - [Added ability to configure the web service endpoint](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/330184)
 - [Improved code readability in Quiz extension by reformatting code](https://gerrit.wikimedia.org/r/325097)

Each of these tasks had one or more mentors assigned and nearly every mentor I worked with at Wikimedia was nice and helpful. I would like to thank AKlapper ([Andre Klapper](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:AKlapper_(WMF))), Reedy ([Sam Reed](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Reedy)), FlorianSW ([Florian Schmidt](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Florianschmidtwelzow)), Mvolz ([Marielle Volz](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Mvolz)), Jdlrobson ([Jon Robson](https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/User:Jdlrobson)) and many other WMF employees along with volunteer contributors; you guys are doing amazing work for community. I spent my best time of my life during the contest when working with Wikimedia and I decided to keep up contributing to MediaWiki as volunteer in my free time. :heart:

## Will I participate next year?

Sure, **yes, I will**! Taking all my experience I've got over the last month I can only recommend everyone who is reading this to take part in next year's Google Code-in. It let's you feel important, because you get to code real-life things and be a part of the community that power some highly used piece of software.

P.S. You can still jump into GCI 2016 before 13th January 2017, so go ahead and take a look inside! :wave:
