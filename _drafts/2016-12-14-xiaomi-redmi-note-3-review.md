Recently, I ordered my new Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 from China on Aliexpress.com and was excited about how this device will perform as a daily driver. At the beginning I wasn't sure if the price is just a scam or if the build quality would suffer a lot. But after a month of experimenting around with custom ROMs and using it as a daily driver, I decided to give my final review about that beast.

In the first and second section I will discuss the advantages and disadvantages of the Xiaomi Redmi Note 3 and lastly, I will give my final verdict, considering all issues I noticed when installing custom ROMs of course.
