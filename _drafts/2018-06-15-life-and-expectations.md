A long time ago I wrote about my life here and a lot has happened since that moment. Anyone who may be following me on Twitter knows that in the last few months I have often felt bad in my life, from depressions to suicidal thoughts. I was on the verge of despair, everything seemed to me to be useless. But from the outside nobody could guess what was going on with me, many thought I had become lazy or would not like to continue working on some projects.

## A lot has happened since then
My last blog post about my thoughts was a few months ago in November last year. In this post I described among other things how I felt 2 years after moving to Poland and how I tried to find myself in a completely different culture and society. While I started with great hope after the move, with every further defeat I lost the desire to live, it seemed as if my life was going down the wrong path. It had been too much, I started to have depression and ignore everything around me, nobody could understand me and I didn't know what was wrong with me. I became more and more isolated from people because I was convinced that they would only harm me. I couldn't believe anyone anymore, no matter which gender or what age, I got scared. And that's because I felt in love with the wrong girl...

### The lost trust in people
At the time, I seriously thought the relationship would always last, at least a little long enough. I was blind and couldn't see anything that could destroy the relationship, so the thought of a long lasting relationship. Today when I look back I only laugh at myself and my naivety, that I didn't see how she actually ignored me and devoted most of her time to her best friend. A month later after we broke up, I found out she is in a relationship with that guy, ouch. They are still together today, even married, so in the end it went well for them. But for me it was a hard slap in the face, I started looking for reasons why it happened that way for me.

It was horrible for me, I lost valuable time in life with it instead of bringing it over me and forgetting about it. But the next problem was in front of me, so I lost my focus on my past relationship and went ahead.

### When you lose friends because of a change
At this point I also had to change classes because the profile (especially math) was too difficult for me. The change for me also meant the loss of contact with some friends from the former class. And the sad thing is that to this day I rarely have contact with them. Sometimes when we meet, we greet each other, exchange a few lines and move on. No invitations to partys, no meetings outside school, nothing. Just sad, but that's just the way it ends, right?

When I talked to others who left the class, it turned out that it was not necessarily the way I thought it was. They were still talking with them, having fun together and not treating them like they would be not in their class anymore. But on the other hand, it's my own fault, I hardly talked to them for a while and gave the impression that I would ignore them or not be interested in anything social. But well, these are expectations of the society and I failed those.

### Accept yourself the way you are
It sounds easier said than done and did not believe in this saying at first, but there is something true about it. If you don't accept yourself then you don't start to meet your own expectations anymore. And this again can only make you more sad, it is only a matter of time until you start not to accept yourself and the things in your life. You probably think it's not visible from the outside and you may be right. But closer friends may see that and start thinking what is wrong with you. Now it's up to you whether you talk to them about what has happened or if you keep it closed and fall into a loop that's hard for you to get out of.

## Expectations are... unpredictable?
You never know when it's gonna happen for real. This was also the case with me, I had expectations of myself, but I always failed in fulfilling them. Over the past 2 years a lot has happened, mostly bad things, but actually these bad things taught me a lot in my life. And even if not, then I know at least what I should be careful about when it will happen again. Instead of focusing on expectations and thinking about how to adapt to others to meet their expectations, I just started to live my own life. 

Maybe this didn't bring me so many friends, but at least I learned to know some with whom I still understand well and are always there, no matter at what times. They helped me a lot and even if they live far away, we have fun over the Internet and hope to meet soon in real life.

### "Don't fear the unknown"
This quote means more to me than just one thing. First of all it will remind me that I would never have known the love of my life if I hadn't approached her when I was dancing. I really don't know what it would have been like if I hadn't done that, because I never had the guts to approach her at school before. Anyway, I didn't expect us to ever get together then, but now it's happened and I'm very happy about it. It may sound like a fairy tale, but it has become reality now.

I honestly had many fears before we were in a relationship. Most of them were fears from the past, from my previous relationships. Even when I no longer have any reason to be afraid, some fear still remains in the background of my mind and sometimes drags me down too. Sometimes you just need to trust yourself and give the other person a chance to prove that your fears are wrong.

But just because it didn't work out for you then in the past, it doesn't have to mean that it will always be like that. So keep this in your mind if you see a chance, but somehow you are afraid to do it. I mean, even if you got rejected in the end or it didn't went as you have expected, why don't you just try it huh?

### Love is not only happiness
Now it starts to be emotional. Well, like really. Past experiences or memories might sound like something worth remembering forever, but not when the person you shared those isn't anymore the same as it was in the past. While someone who has recently broken up could search and look for someone else to get his or her relationship past behind, some might just think that they will now finally be living a single life. But things can suddenly change, unexpectedly, oh well. This is where expectations are unpredictable. To be honest, after I got rejected a year ago, I was looking for a girl so desperate, that in the end I just gave up in October 2017 and lived alone. Instead I just focused back on having friends, as I was already lost in school due to the fact that I have changed classes twice.

Moving forward in time, it's February 2018 and Valentines Day was coming up, so I just had an idea with a friend to send some stupid valentines card along with a link to some dead memes, as a response to the idea that some friends from the higher class had the previous year. And while it gave me some joy in my life, it has also drawn attention to us, but in a positive way. 

### But wait, you said "some joy", what was happening?
In December 2017 I was attending Google Code-in, as some of you might remember, and I was working hard as always, but also because it was my last time I could participate. With that in mind I was also working with the goal of maybe becoming a Grand Prize Winner, as I wanted to visit new places and have a break from my daily boring life back then. Meanwhile also people have started to annoy me with their parties, as they were talking about them loud in class but no one has ever invited me to one of those parties, so thanks.

Then in January 2018 after New Year's Eve I had probably the biggest depression of my life, I became Google Code-in Finalist again and missed my goals and had enough of my life, I just had no reason to live anymore and started drinking more...

## Winterbreak 2018
